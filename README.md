This is a simple react skeleton.
It uses the following npm packages:
1. Browserify
2. Watchify
3. Babel
4. Babelify
5. Babel preset react
6. Bable preset es2015

I have included some basic test data to test that everything is working. In src/react/components you will find two 
files List.jsx and ListItem.jsx. These are the test files. You can delete them after making sure that the skeleton 
works. In src/react you have the main entry point App.jsx file. You should customize it according to your needs. Also
the main index.html file in public should also be customized. 

All you have to do to start is run npm install and then npm start.
Npm start will start watchify in your terminal and compile from App.jsx to main.js in public/js.
